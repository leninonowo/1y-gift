                <p>since i've known you, my heart has beaten differently, my life has gained more color, my soul has been calmed down by your warmness. i feel love in its purest form when you lie your head on my chest, i feel hapiness in its purest form when i hear your laugh. our moments are preciously perfect and there's nothing to be changed, hope we can still be adding good memories to our memory book of life, from the bottom of my messy heart, i love you.</p>
